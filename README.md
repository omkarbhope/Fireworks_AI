# Identity Verification PoC using Firework AI

## Overview
This proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates the use of Firework AIâ€™s platform and APIs to automate the extraction of necessary information for identity verification from provided documents. This application leverages `llama-v3p2-11b-vision-instruct` model from Fireworks_AI. 

The application consists of a front-end and several back-end services that handle different aspects of the workflow:

### Frontend
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Basic components for user interaction and display.
- **Image Assets:** Visual elements for user guidance.

### Backend Services
- **Main Application (`main.py`):** Orchestrates the server and routes.
- **Fireworks Client (`services/fireworks_client.py`):** Manages API calls to Firework AI for processing documents.
- **File Handler (`services/file_handler.py`):** Controls file uploads and storage.
- **Date Check (`services/date_check.py`):** Verifies the validity of dates extracted from documents.

### Workflow structure:

- Welcome Page
- Click on continue to go to user page
- Enter user details and upload file to verify identify
- Click on verify Identity
- Results Success (Show User Data) / Failure (Show Error: Error type)

### Design Choice:

- User inputs name, DOB, address, file.
- Verify Identity button calls the Fireworks API
- The `llama-v3p2-11b-vision-instruct` extracts (Document_type, Document_number, Name, Sex, DOB, Expiry_Date, Address) from the image.
- Image extraction can be faulty at times, to tackle this error the function is called 5 times. Maximum occurence of each value is taken and an aggregated result is generated.
- 5 API calls are made parallely using async and await functions.
- The Dates are brought to common format (MM/DD/YYYY)
- The DOB on ID is compared with user input
- If the dates are mismatched - Invalid date error is thrown
- If the ID is expired  - Expired ID error is thrown.
